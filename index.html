    <p><strong>Canada</strong> is a country in the northern part of North America. Its ten provinces and three
        territories extend from the Atlantic to the Pacific and northward into the Arctic Ocean, covering 9.98 million
        square kilometres (3.85
        million square miles), making it the world's second-largest country by total area. Its southern and western
        border with the United States, stretching 8,891 kilometres (5,525 mi), is the world's longest bi-national land
        border. Canada's capital is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottawa">Ottawa</a>, and its three largest
        metropolitan areas are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto">Toronto</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montreal"> Montreal</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vancouver">Vancouver.</a></p>

    <p>Various Indigenous peoples inhabited what is now Canada for thousands of years before European colonization.
        Beginning in the 16th century, British and French expeditions explored and later settled along the Atlantic
        coast.
        As a consequence of various armed conflicts, France ceded nearly all of its colonies in North America in 1763.
        In 1867, with the union of three British North American colonies through Confederation, Canada was formed as a
        federal
        dominion of four provinces. This began an accretion of provinces and territories and a process of increasing
        autonomy from the United Kingdom. This widening autonomy was highlighted by the Statute of Westminster 1931 and
        culminated in the Canada Act 1982, which severed the vestiges of legal dependence on the British Parliament.</p>

    <p>Canada is a parliamentary democracy and a constitutional monarchy in the Westminster tradition, with a monarch
        and a
        prime minister who serves as the chair of the Cabinet and head of government. The country is a Commonwealth
        realm
        and is officially bilingual at the federal level. It ranks among the highest in international measurements of
        government transparency, civil liberties, quality of life, economic freedom, and education. It is one of the
        world's
        most ethnically diverse and multicultural nations, the product of large-scale immigration from many other
        countries.
        Canada's long and complex relationship with the United States has had a significant impact on its economy and
        culture.</p>

    <p>As a highly developed country, Canada has the seventeenth-highest nominal per-capita income globally as well as
        the
        thirteenth-highest ranking in the Human Development Index. Its advanced economy is the tenth-largest in the
        world,
        relying chiefly upon its abundant natural resources and well-developed international trade networks. Canada is
        part
        of several major international and intergovernmental institutions or groupings including the United Nations,
        NATO,
        the G7, the Group of Ten, the G20, the United States–Mexico–Canada Agreement, the Commonwealth of Nations, the
        Organisation internationale de la Francophonie, and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum.</p>
