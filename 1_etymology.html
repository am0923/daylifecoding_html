    <h2>Etymology</h2>
    <p>While a variety of theories have been postulated for the etymological origins of Canada, the name is now accepted
        as coming from the St. Lawrence Iroquoian word kanata, meaning "village" or "settlement". In 1535,
        Indigenous inhabitants of the present-day Quebec City region used the word to direct French explorer Jacques
        Cartier to the village of Stadacona. Cartier later used the word Canada to refer not only to that particular
        village but to the entire area subject to Donnacona (the chief at Stadacona); by 1545, European books and
        maps had begun referring to this small region along the Saint Lawrence River as Canada.

        From the 16th to the early 18th century "Canada" referred to the part of New France that lay along the Saint
        Lawrence River. In 1791, the area became two British colonies called Upper Canada and Lower Canada
        collectively named the Canadas; until their union as the British Province of Canada in 1841. Upon
        Confederation in 1867, Canada was adopted as the legal name for the new country at the London Conference, and
        the word Dominion was conferred as the country's title. By the 1950s, the term Dominion of Canada was no
        longer used by the United Kingdom, which considered Canada a "Realm of the Commonwealth". The government of
        Louis St. Laurent ended the practice of using Dominion in the statutes of Canada in 1951.

        In 1982, the passage of the Canada Act, bringing the Constitution of Canada fully under Canadian control,
        referred only to Canada, while later that year the name of the national holiday was changed from Dominion Day to
        Canada Day. The term Dominion was used to distinguish the federal government from the provinces, though
        after the Second World War the term federal had replaced dominion.
